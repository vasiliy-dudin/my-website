	## About the meetup
	The first accessibility meetup in Russia. The meetup is aimed at frontend developers, UI and UX designers, QA engineers, copywriters, UX writers, managers and project leaders.
	
	Accessibility, or a11y for short, is a set of methods and technologies for creating interfaces for people with special needs. However, following these guidelines helps make interfaces more convenient and accessible for everyone.
